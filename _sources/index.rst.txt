Ace-TN is a framework for simulating infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) with a focus on
GPU acceleration. We follow a simple pythonic design philosophy with PyTorch tensors as the primary 
tensor-network building blocks, allowing users to quickly setup and manage iPEPS calculations on GPUs.

See our preprint at `https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13900 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13900>`_.

Features
--------

- Fast iPEPS ground-state calculations using GPUs.
- Flexible interface for custom model hamiltonian design.
- Modular and extensible design enabling quick integration of new iPEPS algorithms in a multi-GPU setting.

Code Example
-------------

The basic workflow of an iPEPS ground-state calculation with Ace-TN can be executed with

.. code-block:: python

    from acetn.ipeps import Ipeps
    ipeps = Ipeps(config)
    ipeps.evolve(dtau=0.01, steps=500)
    measurements = ipeps.measure()

Please see the `User Guide <source/user_guide.html>`_ for more info on usage and getting started.
